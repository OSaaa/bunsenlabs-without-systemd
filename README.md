BunsenLabs Without systemd

This script will convert Devuan Jessie 1.0.0 LTS for amd64 into bunsenlabs 8.7 (last stable at the time of release).

In theory it should work with any Debian distro (and the next Devuan versions that integrate s6, runit or any  init system other than sysvinit), but it has only been tested under a normal desktop usage with the sysvinit version (the only one currently available).
